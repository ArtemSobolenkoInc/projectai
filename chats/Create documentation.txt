Please, use this requirements for documentation

and this project has created on Spring boot


o	Create the endpoint that accept parameters. Endpoint could accept from 0 to 3 parameters, type string, number, string. Naming is optional.
o	Make a request to the public `REST Countries` API using endpoint https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all
o	Parse retrieved API response data in JSON to variable/object.


o	Create a function that accepts a string as an attribute and can filter by country `name/common`. 
o	The filter should search for countries names that contains string from attributes (e.g. providing `st` as attribute I could find `Estonia`, providing `Sp` I could find `Spain`)
o	search should not be case sensitive(e.g. providing `sT` I could find `Estonia`)

o	Create a function that accepts a number as an attribute and can filter by ` population `. 
o	The filter should search for countries where the population is less than provided number from attributes in the millions of people (e.g. by providing attribute `10`, I should find countries with a population less than 10m)

o	Create a function that accepts a string as an attribute and can sort data by ` name/common `. 
o	The sort should accept string ` ascend or descend ` and sort countries name by provided attribute (e.g. providing attribute ascend all countries should be sorted from A to Z)

o	Create a function that accepts numbers as an attribute and can limit the amount of data. 
o	The functionality should accept numbers and retrieve first n records (e.g. providing number `15` I should receive 15 first record from API).

5. GET /api/countries/limit?limit={limit}
Limits the number of retrieved countries based on the provided attribute.

limit: The number attribute representing the maximum number of countries to retrieve.
Example: GET /api/countries/limit?limit=15

6. GET /api/countries/combined?name={name}&population={population}&sort={sortType}&limit={limit}
Combines filtering, sorting, and pagination functionality to retrieve processed data.

name: The string attribute to filter country names.
population: The number attribute representing the maximum population (in millions).
sortType: The string attribute specifying the sorting order ("ascend" or "descend").
limit: The number attribute representing the maximum number of countries to retrieve.
Example: GET /api/countries/combined?name=st&population=10&sort=ascend&limit=15

Example URLs
Here are some example URLs to demonstrate the usage of the developed endpoints:

Retrieve all countries:

GET /api/countries
Filter countries by name:

GET /api/countries/filterByName?name=st
Filter countries by population:

GET /api/countries/filterByPopulation?population=10
Sort countries by name:

GET /api/countries/sortByName?sort=ascend

## Application Description

The project is a Spring Boot application that provides functionality to retrieve and process country data from the public REST Countries API. The application aims to facilitate easy access to country information and offers various features for filtering, sorting, and pagination of the retrieved data.

The application leverages the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) to fetch comprehensive information about countries worldwide. It provides endpoints that allow users to query and manipulate the data based on specific criteria.

With the implemented endpoints, users can retrieve all countries or apply filters to search for countries based on name and population. Additionally, the application offers sorting capabilities to order the countries by name in ascending or descending order. Users can also limit the number of retrieved records to streamline the data according to their needs.

By combining these functionalities, users can perform powerful queries and obtain relevant country information. The project's design aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient experience for exploring and analyzing country data.

The project utilizes Spring Boot's framework, allowing for easy development, testing, and deployment of the application. It follows RESTful principles, enabling standard communication between the client and server. The application's codebase adheres to best practices and maintains a modular structure for scalability and maintainability.
